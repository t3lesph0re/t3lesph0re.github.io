I'm t3lesph0re — pen tester, security researcher, and founder of [Deep Woods Security](https://deepwoodssec.com).

I spend most of my time breaking into networks, writing about what I find, and building tools to make offensive work more efficient. This blog is where I document walkthroughs, techniques from real engagements, and eventually original security research.
