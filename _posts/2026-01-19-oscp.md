I passed the OSCP+ on January 19, 2026.

## the exam

The OffSec Certified Professional is a 24-hour hands-on penetration testing exam. No multiple choice. No theory questions. You get a set of machines and a time limit — break in, document everything, submit the report. The "+" designation means I met the additional criteria OffSec introduced for the updated exam format.

## the prep

I am not going to sugarcoat it — this cert took real effort. Months of lab time, hundreds of boxes, and learning to stay calm when nothing is working at 3am with the clock running. The exam tests your ability to enumerate under pressure, chain findings together, and think clearly when you are tired.

The biggest lesson was not technical. It was patience. When you hit a wall, step back. Breathe. Re-enumerate. The answer is usually in something you already found but overlooked.

## what it means

The OSCP does not make you an expert. It proves you can hack machines in a controlled environment under time pressure. What it really gave me was a methodology — a structured way to approach any target, any network, any engagement. That is what carries forward into real work.

On to the next one.
