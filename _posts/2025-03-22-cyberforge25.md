title: "CyberForge '25"

I did my first cybersecurity presentation today!

Learned a ton. Public speaking is definitely a skill that I want to hone further. This experience highlights the importance of communication and soft skills for cybersecurity professionals. For this event, I discussed my struggles and journey to landing my first cybersecurity job. A lot of information to cover, but I feel my message was delivered. I hope to do more of these—looking forward to CyberForge ’26.
